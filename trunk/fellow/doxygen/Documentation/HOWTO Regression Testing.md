HOWTO: Regression Testing
===================================================

Several issues were fixed over time in WinFellow's emulation core. 
To avoid them resurfacing in the future, the following tests should be performed 
on a regular basis, at the very least after major changes.

When testing large batches of titles, to speed up testing it is possible to make
the emulation run at maximum speed by setting the configuration file option
_sound_output=interrupts_; this can also be configured in Amiga Forever's 
override.ini, allowing quick testing of a group of RP9 packages.

r749: Changed the constant for lines in a frame
-----------------------------------------------
Test that the demo "Global Trash" by The Silents will proceed beyond the second
screen and display the "Global Trash" logo. Before this commit, it would freeze
before that appeared.

r764: Flags for eorw and orw, calculation of flags fixed
--------------------------------------------------------
Test that Micro Machines [cr CSL] can be started without issues/the main menu
appear. Before this commit, it would crash after the cracktro.

r814: removed filling in mfm encoding of floppy sectors
-------------------------------------------------------
Test that Ballistix [cr Defjam] can be started without issues. Before this commit,
it froze right after starting it up.

r824: Changed how the CPU driven sound stub issues irq's
--------------------------------------------------------
Test that Ballistix [cr Defjam] can be started without issues. Before this commit,
it would freeze before displaying the Psyclapse logo.

Other known titles affected:
Bombuzal, Brides of Dracula, Dungeon Master, F-18 Interceptor,
Fiendish Freddy, Grand Prix Circuit, Indiana Jones 3,
Loom, Neuromancer, Personal Nightmare, 
Revenge of the Mutant Camels, Robocop, Test Drive,
Test Drive 2, Vroom, Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego,
Wings of Fury

r831: Redesigned chipset interrupt handling
-------------------------------------------
Test that "Seeing is Believing" can be started without issues - 
before this commit, the session would freeze immediately upon start.

Other known titles affected:
Championship Manager 95 Italy, Crystal Kingdom Dizzy, Flashback,
Life & Death, Lionheart, Nitro, Pacland, Pipemania, Populous,
Puffy's Saga, Speedball, Ugh!

r832: fixed movep instruction bug, improved CPU exception handling
------------------------------------------------------------------
Test that Airborne Ranger can be started sucessfully, without graphical issues.
Before this commit, the screen would look garbled.

Other known titles affected:
Barbarian 1 (Psygnosis), Fire Force, KGB, Larry 3, Larry 5, Police Quest 2,
The Lost Vikings.

r833: More checks for emulation stop (ie F11) to avoid deadlock in rare cases.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No test case is known yet.

r865: Loaders using disksync different from 0x4489 and 0x8914 with standard ADF files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test that Prince of Persia loads. It would not start earlier.

Test that Lemmings 2 (uncracked) loads successfully; before the fix, it would
indefinitely read from the floppy disk while loading the main menu.

Comment in 0.4.4 source also suggests North and South is affected, though this could not be
reproduced recently. This fix supersedes the fix in r843, which did not take 0x8914 into 
account.

r873: floppy words per line should be 2 instead of 3
----------------------------------------------------
Test that Guardian Dragon II loads successfully, and continues beyond the first Kefrens logo.
The scrolling text between the two blue statues needs to appear. Before this change, the
sound would start garbling and the emulation session would reboot.

r888: sprites in hires dual playfield mode
------------------------------------------
Test that during the loader screen in Decaying Paradise by Andromeda, a blue rotating 
triangle-shaped logo is visible. Before this change, the triangle was invisible.

r897: Alt+F4 in RetroPlatform mode when undo is enabled and a change was performed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test that Alt+F4 in RetroPlatform mode will close the emulation session. 
Perform a write operation on a floppy where undo is enabled, and close the session 
using Alt+F4. The undo dialog must be usable both when clicking ok or cancel.
Before this change, the emulation session would always be closed.

r898: increased sprite action/merge item list sizes to a maximum of 5.000 entries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start the 1MB chipmem version of State of the Art (Spaceballs) with only 512kB of
chipmem configured. The demo will cause a crash of the emulator session, but the 
emulator should remain responsive.
Before this change, a crash to the desktop would occur.

r906: Sprite DMA was being disabled instead of waiting
------------------------------------------------------
Start Arkanoid, hit F1 and start in round 7 (move mouse to the right to select 
level). Verify that enemy sprites are coming down from the top of the screen. 
Before this change, they were not visible.

Arkanoid is updating vstart/vstop with the copper.

r941: reset of RetroPlatform reset causes input devices to no longer function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start the A500 system, click into the emulator window to capture the cursor.
Hold Esc to release cursor, click the Power symbol and select Reset.
After the reset, verify that the mouse is usable in Workbench.

r949: PC -2 saved on the stack for address exception
----------------------------------------------------
Start the game Double Dragon II [cr Oracle] and verify that it loads the main
menu after exiting the cracktro by hitting Enter.

Before this change, a loader animation would be displayed indefinitely.

r950: proper "short frame" when display is interlaced and frame is short
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start the game Project-X Special Edition '93 and enter the game. Before
this change, there would be graphical corruption and the emulator would
become unresponsive.

r954: fix copper list load
--------------------------
Start the demo Sequential by Andromeda with automatic interlace compensation.
The (interlaced) intro graphic must be displayed properly, without interlace
flickering.

Before this change, it would have inverted lines.

Also affected by this is the game The Ninja Warriors; the game would not load 
before this change and can now be started.

If copper DMA was off during "end of frame", and is being turned on for the first
time after that, it also loads the copper list pointer.

r955: graph frame pointer NULL pointer exception
------------------------------------------------
Start the game First Samurai and proceed through the intro. When prompted
to insert disk 2 into DF0:, do not change the disk, just press fire. The
game will crash, but the emulation session should remain open indefinitely.

Before this commit, the emulator would crash to the desktop with a NULL
pointer exception.

r957: clear dma pending flag when blit is initiated from enabling dma in wdmacon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start the demo "Megademo 8" (Kefrens). Enter the "snake bite" section and verify
that it loads normally.

Before this change, the emulator would hang in an endless loop and become
unresponsive.

r958: set floppy change bit high when no disk is selected
---------------------------------------------------------
Start the game "Silkworm [cr Trilogy/t+4 Trilogy]" and verify that the cracktro
can be left by pressing both mouse buttons simultaneously.

Before this commit, it was impossible to proceed beyond the cracktro.

Also known to be affected by this change is the game "Plan 9 From Outer Space", 
which would fail to proceed loading the second disk.

r963: copjmp  lost if triggered while dma was off and copper had already run to the end of its copper list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start the demo Multica by Andromeda with automatic interlace compensation enabled.
Verify that the initial intro screen featuring the Andromeda logo looks right.

Before this commit, it had an issue with inverted lines.

r967: implemented chipmem / bogomem aliasing
--------------------------------------------
Start the demo Wayfarer by Spaceballs with 512kB chipmem and no bogo memory. It should load normally, the
emulator should not crash.

Before this commit, the session would crash. Related titles impacted by this change are Sensible Soccer 1.0,
Cannon Fodder XMAS Edition and Toki.

r971: CIA timer fix
-------------------
Verify in the game Atomix that the main game can be started.

Before this fix, it would hang when entering the game.

r972: RetroPlatform escape key handling
---------------------------------------
Using default escape key ESC

1. verify that the cracktro of Cannon Fodder 2 [cr PDX] can be left by tipping ESC; holding ESC and releasing after the interval should have no effect (release input devices)
2. verify in Turrican II that the main game will be quit when tipping ESC; holding for the configured interval and releasing should have no effect (release input devices)
3. verify that pressing the key for longer than the configured interval releases the mouse cursor BEFORE releasing the key (end of frame handler)
4. verify in the game F-19 Stealth Fighter, that tipping the ESC key will delete a character from the roster; releasing after the configured interval should not have an effect, except to release the input devices
5. verify that using the escape key while emulation is paused will release the devices, but will not send the escape key when the session is resumed (Cannon Fodder 2 cracktro)

Configure escape key to A

1. verify in a Workbench CLI that tipping A will produce an A on the screen; holding and releasing A should have no effect (release input devices)
