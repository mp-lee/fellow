Reference platform:
-------------------

The Fellow Emulator V0.3.3 emulates something that is
approximately an Amiga 500. This means that the Amiga 500
model was used as a reference platform and the emulator
is tuned to provide the CPU and graphics performance of
this particular Amiga. The emulator can however be
configured to provide more CPU power or less graphics
performance.


The virtual hardware emulation-model includes:
----------------------------------------------

-Motorola 68000/010/20/30 CPU instruction set emulation
-OCS graphics (PAL only. All graphics modes. DMA-driven sprites only)
-OCS/ECS blitter
-4 channel stereo 8-bit sound (DMA-driven only)
-Cia emulation (Some minor details omitted)
-OCS Copper emulation.
-4 virtual floppy drives.
-Joystick and mouse emulation.
-Keyboard emulation.
-Up to 11.75 MB Amiga-memory.

Operatingsystem-level drivers:
------------------------------
-Harddisk emulation with hardfiles
-Virtual filesystem


Left to do in emulation core (lots of minor details):
-----------------------------------------------------

-Graphics are line-oriented.  This is sufficient for most programs.
-CPU and Copper-driven sprites. The current implementation only
 supports 8 sprites per line driven by DMA. Normally only games
 multiplex more than 8 sprites horisontally on the same line.
 Sprites in dual hires are not entirely correct at the moment.
-Sprite collisions.
-Blitter has a couple of rare special cases that is not correct.
-Copper timing is not correct in some special cases.
-Support for CPU-driven sound, and attached channels.
-Parallell/serial ports. Can probably be done as a serial.device replacement.


Work in progress:
-----------------

-Win32 port


Contributions:
--------------

You are welcome to make programming contributions. It is however best
if you find something you want to do rather than mailing us and
ask to given some task. Since Fellow is developed on an idealistic
basis, the basic idea is that everyone do something they like.

When you start doing something it is wise to mail some of us to make
sure no one is doing double work.
